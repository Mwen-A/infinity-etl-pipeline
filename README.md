## Project description


An ETL pipeline "elevator pitch"

For the franchise owners who need to understand their customers and be consistent with their data, the infinity Cafes Dashboard is a data processing platform that connects data from different cafes to understand what users want. Unlike the current decentralised, manual system, our product centralises data, predicts trends, and highlights strengths to help the company grow.

### A Dilemma 
### The Problem
- Franchises have different menus at different times
- No understanding of customer preferences 
- Data silos between franchises 
- No live data
- No consistent menus across franchises
### The Current Solution
- Infrequent data analytics
- Data back up in csv files
- Monthly downloads of sales figures sent to the data team
### The Ask

- How to better understand sales trends?
- How to apply insights to all locations?
- How can we share data across franchises?
- Who are our customers?
- What are our customer preferences?
- How can we make suggested menu changes and times?
- What else can we do?

### Our Solution 
- Takes live data to output real-time business insights
- Robust system 
- Centralises data
#### Technologies
Serverless framework


### Setting up the ETL pipeline

1. Download and extract the .zip folder
2. Open up a new bash terminal in a selected IDE
3. Install all the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

### Git source control

Git branches will be divided into a conventional approach: 

* Bugfix - permanent fix for code defects or bugs
* Hotfix - temporary quick fix
* Features - naming convention for feature branches --> `git branch feat/name_of_feature`

### Team setup

#### Definitions of Done

* All requirements of the feature have been fullfilled
* Code has been reviewed and accepted by everyone using pull requests (PR) 
* Code has been tested using unittesting

#### Ways of Working

We work together on most of the more substantial tickets either through Live Share or screen sharing.
This is to fill the gaps in our individual knowledge of certain concepts, tools etc. 

We are encouraged to reach out to each other for help, support and to share the workload.

Our goal is to apply the principles of agile working.
For daily sprints and weekly retros, we will be having a daily 5-minute morning jamboard session focusing on:

* What went well
* What went badly
* Remaining tasks

The weekly retro will follow the same format in more detail and will be up to an hour in duration.
